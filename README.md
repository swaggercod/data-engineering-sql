## 🎯 Learning Path

### Week 1: SQL Fundamentals
Master the basics of querying databases, filtering, sorting, and basic aggregations.

### Weeks 2-4: Intermediate Operations
Dive into joins, advanced queries, database design, and data manipulation (CRUD operations).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with the `basic_sql` folder and work through each day sequentially
2. Complete the Week 1 challenges before moving to intermediate content
3. Progress through `intermediate_sql` at your own pace
4. Practice with the weekly challenges to reinforce your learning

## 📝 Notes

- Each file contains explanations, syntax, and examples
- Challenge files include practice problems to test your understanding
- Files are numbered by day for easy tracking of progress

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

Consider using these tools for practice:
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite for hands-on practice
- Online SQL playgrounds (SQLFiddle, DB Fiddle, etc.)
- Sample databases (Chinook, Northwind, etc.)

## 📈 Progress Tracking
